        %h1 A simpler way to invest in cryptocurrencies
        %br
        %p 
            The cryptocurrency space is constantly changing and many protocols are seeing
            significant growth in both their market cap and their development communities.
            The weekly rebalanced SOVA15 Index will hold the top 15 cryptocurrencies ranked by market 
            cap, volume, and other inputs to ensure liquidity and to offset risk. 
            Own the market instead of picking winners.
        %br
        %p
            With the SOVA15 equal weighted index, there is high equally diversified exposure giving
            more weight to smaller cap cryptocurrencies that may have a higher growth potential compared 
            to other crypto funds that are heavily weighted in either BitCoin or Ethereum. 90% of capital 
            is evenly distributed across the top 15 cryptocurrencis and the other 10% will be used 
            to handle trading and transaction costs. Historically, equal weighted funds have lower 
            volatility and superior long term returns.

                The Sova15 tokens are tied directly to the underlying cryptocurrency assets and in response 
                to adverse market climates, there is a liquidation option within the Ethereum smart contract.
                This protects the asset price from ever falling below the Sova15's share of the underlying assets.
                Sova15 have has also implemented industry best practices for defense against bad actors and 
                Sybil attacks. Strong verification and authentication procedures are in place, ensuring secure
                operations.

                        %p - You only have to hold 1 asset instead of 15 or more.
                        %br
                        %p - Rebalancing a portfolio is a complex and time-consuming task.
                        %br
                        %p - The convenience of buying and holding with broad market exposure.

                    .card-body
                        %p Absolutely. You can purchase as many tokens as you'd like as long as the ICO is still ongoing.

                    %a.collapsed{:data =>{:toggle => "collapse"}, :href => "#collapseTwelve", :role => "button", :aria => {:expanded => false}, :aria => {:controls => "collapseTwelve"}}
                        Why should I participate in the ICO instead if just waiting until Sova15 launches?
                        %i.fas.fa-caret-down.fa-lg.down-arrow
                #collapseTwelve.collapse{:role => "tabpanel", :aria => {:labelledby => "headingTwelve"}, :data => {:parent => "#accordion"}}
                    .card-body
                        %p Sova15 is constructed as a closed-end fund. Post ICO, the only way to acquire the token would be to purchase them on an exchange. However, you would be buying directly from ICO investors who have a big incentive to sell at a premium. The price is largely dictated by the market and some funds have been known to trade at a 50% premium abov NAV (net asset value).
